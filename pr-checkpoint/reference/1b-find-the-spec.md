A repo hosts more than one initiative over its life. The first writes `REQUIREMENTS.md`
and `SPEC.md` at the repo root, and a later one writes its own under
`docs/<initiative>/`. So the copy at the root is not always the one you want, and
grounding on the wrong initiative's spec produces work that is internally consistent
and aimed at the wrong system, which review does not catch.

Say which initiative this work is for, then resolve the file instead of assuming the
root copy:

1. List the candidates: the repo root copy, every `docs/*/` copy, and any other
   location this skill already tells you to check.
2. Read the `Initiative` field of each. That field decides, never the directory name,
   which is a slug somebody chose and can be stale or wrong.
3. Exactly one names your initiative: use it, and say which path you used.
4. None names it: STOP and tell the user what you found and where. Do not fall back to
   the root copy.
5. More than one names it: STOP and name every path. Two files claiming one initiative
   is a thing to report, not to settle by picking one.
6. A candidate carries no `Initiative` field: say so. Where it is the only candidate you
   may use it, and you must say you read a spec with no recorded owner.

When the user hands you an explicit path, use that path. Check its `Initiative` field
the same way, and on a mismatch stop and say whether a file for your initiative sits
somewhere else.

IDs pulled from the wrong file describe another workstream's contract, and the PR body carries them onward.
